                <h2>Campanile di San Marco</h2>
                <p>Let's explore the history of the tower.</p>
                <p>Welcome to Venice! If you're planning a trip to Venice, then this website is for you.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Here you can find resources (essay, video, timeline, podcast, sources) about the Campanile of San Marco (The Belltower of Saint Mark), the tallest structure in the city, that sits just outside the Cathedral of San Marco at the heart of the city. You can start out by reading this blog on the context of the city's historical architecture through this tower, explore a video and interactive timeline, and once you visit the city you can follow by audio guide to take a closer look yourself.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Campanile of San Marco has a long history over a millennium, in which time it has seen the city be transformed from a marshy lagoon to the world's most powerful city to a city heaving under the weight of its visitors. During that time, the tower itself has been transformed and modified many times.</p>
                <br>
                <p>But it's not just about the tower – through the unique history of this tower, the goal is to help you understand the history of Venice, right up to the city of today. Because by exploring the history of this tower, a visitor to Venice can better understand the tension that Venice faces in recent times between maintaining a historic city appearance while providing modern services and amenities.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Your visit to Venice may for the historical composition of the city, such as the floating islands separated by canals, the winding medieval streets, and gorgeous renaissance building. But you are visiting it today, and it's clear that Venice is a place that continues to exist as a city today, not just ancient ruins. There is running water, electricity, an expansive transit network, garbage collection, students, workers, shops, and sports facilities.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Case-in-point, when you arrive in the city of Venice, you will have to do so by car, bus, boat, or train. You'll likely arrive by crossing a bridge, or stepping off a train, or parking a car at a parking lot much like any other city in the world. So the city clearly isn't just a preserved medieval and Renaissance ruin.</p>
                <br>
                <p>And when you do visit ancient churches and monuments, you will see logos for Save Venice and Venice in Peril. Indeed, one of the most popular reputations of Venice that you have probably already encountered is the idea that the city is in danger of sinking or being flooded beneath the water. Countless buildings, paintings, sculptures, and more are in constant threat of various forces of time: wind, rains, floods, chemical pollution, earthquakes, and the very heaving presence of tourists.</p>
                <br>
                <p>With all of the dangers present to the material heritage of Venice, when you visit Venice it is important to recognize that the materials you do see aren't just remnants of a past time, slowly disappearing, but that people have at times intervened to meticulously restore them, to relocate them, or even to entirely rebuild them. Therefore, just like the train station or vehicle bridge you may use to reach Venice, many historical structures and objects that you will see are also intentionally presented based on interventions from the 20th and 21st centuries.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Such is the situation with the Campanile of San Marco. The tower physically standing today was only built in 1912. It was in that year that the tower was unveiled to a triumphant, raucous, and celebratory crowd.</p>
                <br>
                <p>However, I did mention that the tower has a millennium long history. Indeed, in 1902 an earlier version of the tower fell, and this 1912 iteration of the current Campanile was a reconstruction.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Before learning about this 20th century intervention, it's worthwhile to understand the origins of the tower and the previous moments in time when the city had to decide what the purpose of a tower would be.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Origins</p>
                <br>
                <p>The precise moment at which a tower was constructed in the spot of today's Campanile of San Marco is unclear in the misty early years of the lagoon. But it was likely begun during the reign of Doge Pietro Tribuno (887-911), and continued thereafter for some time.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Its original purpose was not as a campanile (i.e. a belltower), but as a watchtower. At this time the young lagoon city was just consolidating its power on the 'Rialto' islands (where the modern city of Venice is), and it was vulnerable not only within the lagoon but from incursions from the mainland and across water. The area where the tower is today was part of a system of fortifications. Having a tower here was important to keep watch over the waters of the lagoon, warn of potential danger, and guide ships to the harbour.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Conversion to a Campanile</p>
                <br>
                <p>By the 12th century, Venice had established herself as an increasingly prosperous and powerful city. As its boundaries grew to encompass not only the entire lagoon, but even well beyond down the Adriatic Sea, the city itself was trading and manufacturing goods at increasingly complex scales. A belfry was added to the tower, including bells, so that the tower could aurally communicate important moments and segments of the day by regulating prayer and working times for the inhabitants of the city.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Doge Domenico Morosini (1147-1156) is credited with adding the bell to the tower in the Doge's Palace:"Sub me admistrandi operis campanile Sancti Marci construitur..."</p>
                <br>
                <p>Disaster Strikes</p>
                <br>
                <p>In 1489, the Campanile was struck by lightning and its top was destroyed due to its wooden construction. When restoring the tower, the construction used wood and stone to help prevent future fires, and an attic was added to the belfry to feature symbols celebrating the city as the peak of its power. One symbol added is an image that was popular in the city at the time: the personification of Venice as the embodiment of Justice. Another was the golden statue of the Archangel Gabriel at the top, which was intended to connect this religious figure with the alleged founding of Venice on March 25th, 421. These symbols celebrate the city's mythic past and legendary present in order to project an image of confidence into the future.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Collapse of the Tower</p>
                <br>
                <p>Over the centuries, the tower continued to face threats and showing its age until it finally collapsed at 8:53AM on July 14, 1902.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After the collapse of the tower, debates ensued about what to do next. Just as at the historical junctures of the tower, when purposeful interventions were made to construct, convert, or restore elements of the tower, what intervention would the city make in the 20th century? What would its purpose be?</p>

                </article>
                <br>
                <p>The day of the collapse, the city council convened and decided that the tower would be rebuilt. But what did 'rebuilding' the tower mean? Would it be in the same location? Would it look exactly the same as it had before the collapse, have some modifications, or be an entirely new design? If the tower would be designed to look the exact same, would it also be faithful to the ancient and medieval internal construction, or would it have modern components to make it more stable?</p>
                <br>
                <p>The debates over these questions were heated, involving the Officials appointed to work on the new tower, the general Venetian and Italian public, and foreign architects, historians, and writers.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Some argued that if the tower were to be rebuilt exactly as it was, it would be a falsification of history, it wouldn't be the real historical tower anymore, and it wouldn't express the character of Venice in the 20th century, nor be fit for purpose for the new age.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Others argued that the tower could be rebuilt in a new spot, perhaps next to or behind the Church of San Marco (instead of in front of it). This would be for aesthetic reasons and because as I have explained the tower originally was not a campanile connected to the church, so there isn't necessarily a need for the campanile to be in front of the church.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When the first foundation stone of the tower was laid on April 12, 1903, it was proclaimed that the tower would be rebuilt "com'era, dov'era", meaning how it looked before, and where it was located before (and that the tower would use more modern construction materials and methods to help ensure the stability of the new tower). This proclamation didn't end the debate between the opposing camps, however, the phrase took on steam and became a rallying cry of the public throughout the tower's construction.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Although the tower wouldn't appear different than it had before, it's still an 'intervention' that expresses a certain historical purpose for the tower. Just like the paintings and sculptures that are restored without making additional modifications other than regaining the historical shine the piece originally had, "com'era, dov'era" seemed to be connect with the public's desire for the stability of their historic symbol in the wake of a long 19th century that utterly and dramatically altered the city. Their independent republic had ended in 1797 before they were passed back and forth under French and Austrian rule until finally joining the unified Italian state. In the end, the tower could represent a symbolic continuum with the city's ancient past. A hedge that they may not need to necessarily risk trying to improve on what their Venetian forebears had built before.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Beyond the tower itself, the debate in the city between preserving its past and innovating for the present and future is always bubbling. For instance, the grand theatre of Venice, La Fenice, burned down in 1996. During its own reconstruction, it was decided to rebuild it "com'era, dov'era".</p>
                <br>
                <p>So when you visit Venice, you can keep in mind that despite an apparent historic appearance, you aren't just seeing aging architecture, but an intentional strategy to sometimes preserve, sometimes modify, and sometimes build anew.</p>
